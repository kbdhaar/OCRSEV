1. mappings - classes lined with fields in table through data properties
race, ethnicity, patid, bmi, blood pressure, tobacco use
2. How to map ‘age’? Is it using date at diagnosis? Or current date/death date?

select datediff((select curdate()), (SELECT birth_date
FROM demographic limit 1))/ 365.25 as age;
3. Gender and sexual orientation (V 3.1) from oneflroida - create fake?
4. BRFSS- fake data? look up table? Lat n long do not match? how to go about mapping?
